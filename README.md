I am making finance analysis in Python to handle big data. In this project, I always update the visualization of graphs and applied financial formulas to understand of finance. I used mainly pandas,numpy, Plotly, and sckitlearn libraries. Enjoy learning 👻. 

## For Graph 📈

I used [Plotly Graph](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) for visualization. Because this library gives dynamic graphs to deeply see each data within. So, You should download my Jupyter Notebook to see graphs on your computer.

## Streamlit Library 💻

[**Streamlit:**](https://ybatuhan-ecobooster-f-financial-analysis-project-with-ml-h3098p.streamlit.app/) I made some part of my project on Streamlit. It provided many tools for achieving my project's visualization. Also, when I made my project, I thought about where I publish my project. Streamlit answered my question. 



  
## Road Map 🗺

- 🔜 I will update of Financial Ratio

- 🔜 I will develop forecasting model

- 🔜 Also, I will add other programing language for comparing.

## Conclusion

This project represents my financial analysis journey. My real major is finance and accounting. I know, finance needs more data and speed to get better results. Thus, Python help me to gain these skills to better make financial analysis 

When I prepared this project and I still developing. Streamlit Library was very challenging for me. Because I had to learn many functions and apply them to the correct order. So, I spent my whole time learning these functions and integrating them into my project. Also, you can read [my other review](https://medium.com/@BatuhanYildirim1148/how-can-you-check-your-s-p-500-companies-portfolio-in-python-b976d1d0565c) about my first project.  you can read some Streamlit tricks. I learned the hard way and publish for you 😊
